Given that focus, here is a refined roadmap that prioritizes features that deliver the most value for personal use and automation, without the overhead of enterprise-level integrations.

### Refined Roadmap for a Personal "Automated Auditor"

This roadmap is built on a single guiding principle: **Maximize Insight, Minimize Friction.**

#### Phase 1: Perfecting the Core Analysis (Immediate Next Steps)

This is about making the current `review` command as intelligent and accurate as possible.

1.  **Integrate `tree-sitter` for Multi-Language AST Analysis:**
    *   **Why:** This is the **single most impactful improvement** you can make. Your `llm-context` prompt is a clever workaround, but it's no substitute for a true Abstract Syntax Tree.
    *   **How:**
        *   Add `tree-sitter` and the relevant language bindings (e.g., `tree-sitter-java`, `tree-sitter-javascript`) to your `requirements.txt`.
        *   Expand your `code_analyzer.py` to be language-aware. It would detect the file type and use the appropriate `tree-sitter` parser to build a generic AST.
        *   From this AST, you can extract function definitions, calls, and class structures for *any* supported language, not just Python.
    *   **Result:** The rich, cross-file context you currently generate for Python will now be available for all major languages, leading to dramatically better vulnerability detection in Java, JavaScript, Go, etc.

2.  **Refine the `DeepDiveAgent` with "Confidence Check" Logic:**
    *   **Why:** Sometimes the main model gives a finding but isn't 100% sure. The agent should be your "second opinion" to eliminate false positives.
    *   **How:**
        *   Modify the agent's trigger in `main_cli.py`. Instead of only running on findings *without* a PoC, also run it on any finding where `confidenceScore` is `"Medium"` or `"Low"`.
        *   Modify the agent's prompt: "You are a validation agent. The primary scanner has reported the following potential vulnerability with medium confidence. Your task is to either **confirm it** by generating a high-confidence PoC or **refute it** and declare it a false positive. Provide your reasoning."
    *   **Result:** Ultron's final report becomes much more reliable. You can trust the "High" confidence findings more, as they've survived a second round of scrutiny.

#### Phase 2: Building the "Intelligence Matrix" (The RAG-Powered Upgrade)

This makes Ultron a learning system that gets better every time you use it. This is a perfect feature for a personal tool, as it will learn *your* coding patterns and the types of mistakes you tend to make.

1.  **Introduce a Local Vector Database:**
    *   **Why:** A local vector DB like `ChromaDB` or `FAISS` (with `SentenceTransformers`) is perfect for personal use. It requires no external services or API keys and keeps all your data private on your machine.
    *   **How:**
        *   Add `chromadb` and `sentence-transformers` to `requirements.txt`.
        *   Create a new module, e.g., `ultron/core/intelligence_matrix.py`. This module will manage initializing the database, embedding text, and performing similarity searches.

2.  **Create a `learn` Command and Augment the `review` Command:**
    *   **How (`learn` command):** Create a new command `ultron learn <path/to/project>` that scans a project, finds all functions/methods, embeds their code, and stores them in the vector DB. This "primes" the matrix with known-good code.
    *   **How (`review` command):**
        *   After a review finds a vulnerability, automatically embed the vulnerable code snippet and the finding's description into the vector DB, marking it as "vulnerable."
        *   Before a *new* review starts, take the code to be analyzed, run a similarity search against the DB, and retrieve the top 3 most similar code snippets (both good and bad).
        *   Inject this retrieved context into the main analysis prompt as "Similar code patterns previously analyzed."
    *   **Result:** Ultron starts to recognize patterns. If you feed it a new piece of code that looks suspiciously like a vulnerability it found last week (even in a different project), it will flag it with much higher accuracy. It's like having an assistant who remembers every piece of code you've ever written.

#### Phase 3: The "Sentinel" - Your Automated Background Watcher

This addresses your core desire for automation in a personal context.

1.  **Create a `watch` Command:**
    *   **Why:** You don't always want to manually run a command. You want Ultron to be your copilot, watching as you work.
    *   **How:**
        *   Add the `watchdog` library to `requirements.txt`.
        *   Create a new command: `ultron watch <path/to/project>`.
        *   This command will use `watchdog` to monitor the specified directory for file modifications (`.py`, `.java`, etc.).
        *   When a file is saved, it will trigger a targeted `ultron review` on **only that single file**.
        *   The output will be printed directly to your terminal. Since it's a single-file scan, it will be very fast.
    *   **Result:** This is the ultimate personal automation. You save a file in your editor, and a second later, Ultron's analysis appears in a separate terminal window. It's like having a live security linter powered by a world-class AI.

This refined three-phase plan gives you a clear path to building the ultimate automated code auditor for personal use. It focuses on intelligence, accuracy, and seamless automation, creating a tool that not only finds bugs but actively learns and assists you as you code.
