The batch of code files to review begins now:
# --- LLM-Generated Project Context ---
# === File: AndroidManifest.xml ===
# This file does not contain function definitions or calls.

# === File: src/com/example/app/MainActivity.java ===
# Defines Methods:
#   - class JSBridge.showToast(String toast) (Lines: 10-13)
#   - public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) (Lines: 20-35)
# Calls:
#   - `System.out.println()` at line 12
#   - `super.onCreate()` at line 21
#   - `new WebView()` at line 22
#   - `setContentView()` at line 23
#   - `webView.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled()` at line 25
#   - `webView.addJavascriptInterface()` at line 26
#   - `getIntent().getStringExtra()` at line 28
#   - `webView.setWebViewClient()` at line 33
#   - `webView.loadUrl()` at line 34

# --- End of LLM-Generated Project Context ---

>so for decompiled code, for the llm-context generated, it is only checking the cuntions or calls, not the code itself. but our main goal is to get context between the files containing the code. so here we have to make sure that the llm context is generated for the code itself, not just the functions or calls.
