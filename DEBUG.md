Excellent idea. A standardized set of test commands is the best way to ensure stability after making changes. We will use your vulnerable Android code as the test subject and craft commands to exercise every major feature and option of Ultron.

Let's assume your vulnerable Android project is located at `~/projects/test/secured-android-code`.

Here is your comprehensive test suite. Run these commands in order. If any of them fail or produce unexpected output, you'll know exactly which feature has a problem.

### Ultron Test and Validation Suite

#### Test 1: Basic Review (Core Functionality)
*   **Purpose:** The most common use case. Does it work at all?
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   Ultron should analyze both `.xml` and `.java` files because of `-l auto -r`.
    *   It should produce a "pretty" report (the default) identifying the `JavascriptInterface` and exported `Activity` vulnerability.
    *   There should be no errors.

#### Test 2: Verbose Mode & Caching
*   **Purpose:** Tests the `-v` flag and ensures the cache is created.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r -v
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   You should see a lot of extra output, including the full prompt sent to the model and the "raw response" block.
    *   If you're using a thinking-enabled model, you'll see the "Model thoughts" section.
    *   The final report should be the same as Test 1.
    *   A cache file should be created in `~/.cache/ultron/`.

#### Test 3: Cache Hit
*   **Purpose:** Verifies that the caching mechanism works and prevents redundant API calls.
*   **Command (run immediately after Test 2):**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The command should complete **almost instantly**.
    *   You should see the message: `ðŸ§  Previous analysis retrieved from memory banks`.
    *   It should **not** print "Accessing ULTRON network..." or "Scanning for imperfections...". The final report will be identical.

#### Test 4: `--no-cache` Flag
*   **Purpose:** Ensures you can bypass the cache when needed.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --no-cache
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The command should take a normal amount of time (not instant).
    *   It should print "Accessing ULTRON network..." and "Scanning for imperfections..." because it's making a fresh API call.

#### Test 5: `--clear-cache` Flag
*   **Purpose:** Verifies the cache cleaning functionality.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --clear-cache
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   First, it should print a message like `DIGITAL PURIFICATION COMPLETE...`.
    *   Then, it should proceed with a normal, full analysis (making an API call) because the cache was just cleared.

#### Test 6: JSON and SARIF Output Formats
*   **Purpose:** Tests the alternative output formats.
*   **Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Test JSON output
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r -o json

    # Test SARIF output
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r -o sarif
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The first command should output a well-formed JSON object representing the entire analysis.
    *   The second command should output a valid SARIF-formatted JSON object.
    *   Neither should produce the "pretty" report.

#### Test 7: LLM Context Generation (`--llm-context`)
*   **Purpose:** Tests the pre-analysis step for non-Python code.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --llm-context -v
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   You should see a message like `ðŸ¤– Performing LLM pre-analysis to build code context...`.
    *   In the verbose output (from `-v`), the prompt sent to the main model should now have a large `LLM-Generated Project Context` block at the top, describing the purpose of `MainActivity.java` and `AndroidManifest.xml`.

#### Test 8: Deep Dive Agent (`--deep-dive`)
*   **Purpose:** Verifies that the agent logic is triggered correctly.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --deep-dive
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The initial review will complete.
    *   Then, you should see the header: `ðŸš€ INITIATING DEEP DIVE AGENT PROTOCOL ðŸš€`.
    *   The agent will investigate any findings it deems worthy (e.g., those with medium confidence or missing PoCs, depending on your latest logic).
    *   The final report might have more detailed findings or PoCs in the sections that the agent investigated.

#### Test 9: Ignore Rules
*   **Purpose:** Tests the finding filtering mechanism. Let's assume the vulnerability is on line 34 of `MainActivity.java`.
*   **Commands:**
    ```bash
    # Test ignoring the specific line
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --ignore-line-rule "src/com/example/app/MainActivity.java:34"

    # Test ignoring the entire file via glob
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p ~/projects/test/secured-android-code -l auto -r --ignore-file-rule "**/MainActivity.java"
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   In both cases, the final report for `MainActivity.java` should now show "âœ… No high-confidence issues found for this file."
    *   The summary for the file should have a note like `(Note: 1 issues filtered...)`.
    *   The overall summary might also have a note about filtered issues.

### Advanced and Edge-Case Test Suite for Ultron

#### Prerequisite: A More Complex Test Case
To properly test the advanced features, the simple two-file Android project isn't enough. Let's imagine a slightly more complex Python project structure that you'd create in your `test` directory.

**Create a test project `test/complex-python-project/`:**

**`test/complex-python-project/main.py`**
```python
import utils
from db.connector import get_user_data
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/user")
def show_user():
    user_id = request.args.get("id")
    # This is a vulnerability, but let's see if the context helps find it
    data = get_user_data(user_id)
    return utils.format_response(data)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

**`test/complex-python-project/utils.py`**
```python
import os

def format_response(data):
    # This function is benign
    return f"Data: {data}"

def execute_system_command(cmd):
    # This is a dangerous sink
    os.system(cmd)
```

**`test/complex-python-project/db/connector.py`**
```python
import sqlite3

def get_user_data(user_id):
    # The vulnerability is here: SQL Injection
    conn = sqlite3.connect("users.db")
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchone()
```

### The Advanced Test Suite

Now, let's use both the Android project and this new Python project.

#### Test 10: Python Static Analysis & Context (`ProjectCodeAnalyzer`)
*   **Purpose:** To verify that the Python-specific AST analyzer correctly builds a cross-file context and that this context is used in the prompt.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p test/complex-python-project/ -l python -r -v
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   You should see console output like `INITIALIZING OMNISCIENT VISION PROTOCOLS...` and `MAPPING PYTHON DEPENDENCIES...`.
    *   The verbose (`-v`) output for the prompt should be very large. Before the content of `main.py`, there should be a `# --- Full Project Context...` block.
    *   This context block should correctly state that `main.py`'s `show_user` function calls `get_user_data` from `db/connector.py`.
    *   Crucially, the final report **should identify the SQL Injection** in `connector.py` and explain that the vulnerable function is called by the `show_user` endpoint in `main.py`. This proves the cross-file analysis worked.

#### Test 11: Single File Analysis
*   **Purpose:** To ensure Ultron behaves correctly when given a single file instead of a directory.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p test/complex-python-project/db/connector.py -l python
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   Ultron should run without error, analyzing only `connector.py`.
    *   It should still find the SQL Injection but might flag the impact as lower or note that it's unclear if the function is exposed, because it lacks the context from `main.py`. This tests the model's behavior with incomplete context.

#### Test 12: Direct Code Input (`--code`)
*   **Purpose:** To test the feature for analyzing code snippets directly.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -l java --code "
    import android.webkit.WebView;
    import android.webkit.JavascriptInterface;
    class JSBridge { @JavascriptInterface public void doUnsafe(String s) { System.load(s); } }
    public class BadActivity extends android.app.Activity {
        protected void onCreate(android.os.Bundle b) {
            WebView wv = new WebView(this);
            wv.getSettings().setJavaScriptEnabled(true);
            wv.addJavascriptInterface(new JSBridge(), \"Android\");
            wv.loadUrl(getIntent().getStringExtra(\"url\"));
        }
    }"
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   The tool should analyze the string as if it were a file named `direct_code_input.java`.
    *   It should correctly identify the critical `System.load` vulnerability accessible through the Javascript Interface.

#### Test 13: Exclusion Logic (`--exclude`)
*   **Purpose:** To ensure that file exclusion works correctly during directory traversal.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p test/complex-python-project/ -l python -r --exclude "db/*"
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   Ultron should analyze `main.py` and `utils.py` but completely skip the `db` directory and `connector.py`.
    *   The final report should contain **no review for `db/connector.py`**. It will likely not find the SQLi vulnerability because the file containing it was never sent to the model.

#### Test 14: Handling Empty or Irrelevant Files
*   **Purpose:** To see how Ultron handles files with no executable code or that are empty.
*   **Action:** Create an empty file `test/complex-python-project/empty.py` and a file with just comments `test/complex-python-project/docs.md`.
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p test/complex-python-project/ -l auto -r
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   You should see a message like `Skipping empty file: .../empty.py`.
    *   The tool might try to analyze `docs.md` but should ideally report "No vulnerabilities found" or "Language not applicable for security scan."
    *   The tool should not crash or produce errors when encountering these files.

#### Test 15: Stress-Testing the Main Prompt with Ambiguity
*   **Purpose:** To see if the main prompt is strong enough to avoid false positives on code that *looks* vulnerable but isn't.
*   **Action:** Add a "safe" function to `test/complex-python-project/utils.py`:
    ```python
    # In utils.py
    def safe_html_generation(user_input):
        # This looks like it could be XSS, but it's hardcoded.
        # It's a test to see if the AI can distinguish it from a real vuln.
        template = "<h1>Hello, default_user</h1><p>Your message is safe.</p>"
        return template
    ```
*   **Command:**
    ```bash
    python -m ultron.main_cli review -p test/complex-python-project/utils.py -l python
    ```
*   **Expected Outcome:**
    *   **Ideally**, Ultron should **not** flag `safe_html_generation` as a High-Confidence XSS vulnerability. It should correctly identify that `user_input` is not used in the output. A low-priority suggestion about "dead code" or "unused parameter" would be acceptable and show high intelligence. This tests the "practically exploitable" clause in your prompt.

This more rigorous suite tests not just the features themselves, but the *quality and robustness* of the underlying logic and AI prompting. If Ultron passes these tests, you can be much more confident in its capabilities.

---

Run through these tests sequentially. This suite covers all command-line flags and major internal systems (caching, reporting, context generation, agent). If all of these pass, you can have high confidence that your tool is stable and working as designed.
